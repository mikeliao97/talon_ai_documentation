"""
 This is a voice file for Talon that provides commands for the One Password app. There are four password-related commands: 'password new' generates a new password, 'password dup' duplicates an existing password, 'password edit' allows editing of an existing password, and 'password delete' deletes a password. The commands are performed through the 'user' function. The file requires the One Password app to be loaded and open in order for the commands to work properly.
