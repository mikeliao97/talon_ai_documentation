 The file explains how to activate two commands in Talon voice application and what they do. The first command, "password fill," activates the "user.password_fill()" function which presumably fills in a password field for the user. The second command, "password show," triggers the "user.password_show()" function which probably shows the user what they have typed in the password field. The file is incomplete as it has a #todo tag, indicating that tags are yet to be added.
"""#todo: tags
password fill: user.password_fill()
password show: user.password_show()
