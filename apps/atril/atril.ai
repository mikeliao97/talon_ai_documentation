"""
 This is a talon voice file for the app Atril. It defines several user actions related to navigating pages, such as jumping to the next or previous page, going to a specific page number, and finding the final page. Each action is associated with a specific keyboard shortcut that the script triggers using the "actions.key()" function. The script also defines a context and module for the Atril app to allow the actions to be activated only when the app is active.
