 This file provides commands for the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC application that can be activated through voice using the Talon software. The commands are organized into two categories: tab and page navigation. The tab navigation commands allow the user to open, close, and navigate between tabs, as well as duplicate tabs or jump to a specific tab. The page navigation commands allow the user to navigate between pages in the document, jump to a specific page, or go to the last page. The file also includes app definition code for Talon to identify the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC application on Windows operating systems.
