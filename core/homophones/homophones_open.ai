"""
 This is a file for a voice command system called Talon. The file provides commands related to homophones, including selecting and inserting them based on a specified number. The commands can also format the selected homophones based on user-defined text formatters. The commands are triggered by saying "choose" followed by the homophone number or formatters and homophone number. The command "user.homophones_hide()" is used to hide the homophone options after selecting one.
