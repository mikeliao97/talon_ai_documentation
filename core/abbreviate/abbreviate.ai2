"""
 This file contains a list of common abbreviations along with their spoken forms. The list is stored in a dictionary called "abbreviations", with the abbreviation as the key and the spoken form as the value. There is also a module called "mod" that allows the abbreviated form of a command to be used as a spoken phrase. The commands are activated with the following format: "abbreviate {abbreviation}", where {abbreviation} is the relevant abbreviation that you want to expand. The Context class is used to store the list of abbreviations to be used by the module, and there is also a function that allows for the import of user-defined abbreviations. The purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to easily expand abbreviations while using voice commands in the Talon software.
