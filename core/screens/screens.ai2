"""
 This file is part of the Talon voice software and contains a module with actions to handle multiple screens. The functions provided include showing the screen number of each screen, getting a screen by number, and getting the previous or next screen relative to a given screen. The screens are sorted from left to right and top to bottom. The `screens_show_numbering()` command shows the screen number in the center of each screen. The other commands are `screens_get_by_number(screen_number)`, `screens_get_previous(screen)`, and `screens_get_next(screen)`. The `get_sorted_screens()` function returns a list of screens sorted from left to right and top to bottom. The `show_screen_number(screen, number)` function displays the screen number as a text overlay on the screen. The commands are activated via voice commands in the Talon software.
