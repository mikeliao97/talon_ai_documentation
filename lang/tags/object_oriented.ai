"""
 This is a talon voice file that provides basic commands for object-oriented programming. The commands are activated by using the "code_object_oriented" tag provided by the Talon module. The file contains three commands: "code_operator_object_accessor" inserts an object accessor operator, "code_self" inserts a reference to the current object, and "code_define_class" starts a class definition. These commands are defined within the "@mod.action_class" and can be used within the "ctx" context.
