"""
 This is a Talon voice file that involves commands related to anonymous functions in various programming languages such as Haskell and Rust. The file provides a command to activate the syntax for anonymous functions, called "op lambda", which can be used to define and call anonymous functions. The file also includes a context and module for enabling commands related to anonymous functions, and an action class for defining the "code_operator_lambda" command.

# In many languages, anonymous functions aren't merely infix syntax:
#
#       Haskell  '\x -> bla'
#       OCaml    'fun x -> bla'
#       Rust     '|x| { bla }'
#
# Therefore a revision of this command may be in order.
