 This file is a script for activating voice commands related to various Unix utilities in the terminal. It contains a dictionary of default Unix utilities and their corresponding spoken commands. The file can be customized by editing a separate CSV file. The script imports modules and sets up a context, then populates a list for use in Talon voice commands. Each utility has a spoken command, such as "grep" for finding text within files, and the corresponding Unix utility command, such as "grep -Hirn".
