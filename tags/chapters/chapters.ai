 The file provides commands to navigate chapters in a reader app using Talon voice software. The commands are activated by saying "chapter next," "chapter last," "go chapter" followed by a number, or "go chapter final." The file defines a module with a tag for reader apps with chapter navigation, and then establishes actions for moving between chapters. These actions include going to the next chapter, the previous chapter, a specific chapter number, and the final chapter.
"""tag: user.chapters
chapter next: user.chapter_next()
chapter last: user.chapter_previous()
go chapter <number>: user.chapter_jump(number)
go chapter final: user.chapter_final()
